# **PyBer analysis**

# Purpose of the Analysis: 
   ** Purpose of the analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. I also need to create a line graph that shows the total week fares for each city type. I will produce a summary of the data that differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer

# Results:
    ** Difference in ride-sharing data among the different city types-
	1) Urban areas had the highest fares and also the most spikes in rates in the year 2019
	2) Suburban areas had the most stable fares and also a few spikes in rates and looks like possibly will go up in rates in the future
	3) Rural areas had the lowest fares , still significant spikes in rates but possibly rates will go down in the future

	Ride-sharing data includes the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type
		**Below is the breakdown of each and analysis of the data

	1)Total fares by city-shows us fares by city type

# Summary:
    ** Three Recommendations

There are huge disparieties between the city types: rural, suburband and urban, ridership varies and so does the pricing. 
	    
        1) I would increase number of drivers in the suburban area.
        2) I would I would charge less in the Urban area and mirror results from Rural area to get ave fare per rider up hence increasing profitibility.
        3) I believe suburban area shows the most consistent results and I would try to adjust total drivers and fares to most closely mimic the subruban area to get more consistent results in the other two areas.
